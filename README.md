# GoalTree

## Problem Space
Popular to-do list apps help users manage their tasks but don't help users create comprehensive to-do lists _for_ particular goals. I believe that goals tend to go unachieved not because of a lack of ability or willpower, but because the steps forward are unclear due to complexity or scale. I created GoalTree to solve this problem and bridge the gap between big-picture planning and task management.

GoalTree helps users thoroughly divide their goals into discrete and achievable tasks by using a tree data structure to conceptualize each goal as a tree of related subgoals. Users can generate to-do lists for each goal tree, which aggregates all the leaf nodes of a goal tree. The app allows users to easily toggle between tree and list view for a particular goal, instantaniously updating a to-do list when its corresponding goal tree is revised and vice-versa.

## Features

## Set Up
To run this project on your local computer, follow the instructions below.

### Backend Set Up

Start by cloning the backend repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/justinakliu/goal-tree-back-end.git
```
Create and activate a virtual environment inside your directory
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
Install the dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Create a database for the application and a .env file. In the .env file, create an environment variable called `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` to hold the path to your database. Your .env file might look like:

```
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI=postgresql+psycopg2://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/goal_tree_database
```
To finish setting up your local database, run:
```
flask db upgrade
```
And finally, to run the backend app:
```
flask run
```

### Frontend Set Up

Clone the frontend repo in a separate directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/justinakliu/goal-tree-front-end.git
```

Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Run the app:

```
npm run dev #
```
<br>

You can now access GoalTree at 'localhost:3000/'!
