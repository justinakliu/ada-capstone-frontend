# GoalTree

## Problem Space
Many productivity apps allow users to manage their task lists, but few help users create a task list for a goal. I believe that most goals go unachieved not because of a lack of ability or willpower, but because the steps forward are unclear due to the complexity or scale of the task at hand. 
I created GoalTree to bridge the gap between big-picture planning and day-to-day task management. A daunting goal is easier to achieve if it is thoroughly divided into discrete, achievable, tasks. GoalTree helps users do just that.
