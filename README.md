# GoalTree

## Problem Space
Popular to-do list apps help users to manage their tasks, but few help users create comprehensive to-do lists _for_ particular goals. I believe that most goals go unachieved not because of a lack of ability or willpower, but because the steps forward are unclear due to complexity or scale. I created GoalTree to solve this problem and bridge the gap between big-picture planning and task management.

GoalTree helps users thoroughly divide their goals into discrete and achievable tasks by using a tree data structure to conceptualize each goal as a tree of related subgoals. Users can generate to-do lists for each goal tree, which aggregates all the leaf nodes of a goal tree.
