# GoalTree

## Problem Space
Many to-do list apps allow users to manage their tasks, but few help users create a comprehensive to-do list for a particular goal. Many goals go unachieved not because of a lack of ability or willpower, but because the steps forward are unclear due to complexity or scale.

I created GoalTree to bridge the gap between big-picture planning and task management. GoalTree helps users thoroughly divide their goals into discrete and achievable tasks by using a tree data structure to conceptualize each goal as a tree of related subgoals. Users can generate to-do lists for each goal tree, which aggregates all the leaf nodes of a goal tree.
